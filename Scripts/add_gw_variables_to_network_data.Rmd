# Overview

The team has constructed a network dataset of California public water systems and the various sources they get their surface water from. 

In this script, we want add two groundwater-related variables to the dataset (for now in a separate table that we can join by PWSID). One being a simple binary just whether the PWS has groundwater or not, and the second being some indicator of if their groundwater meets drinking water standards.


# Set up

Import packages
```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  suppressWarnings({
  library(tidyverse)   # Data wrangling
  library(here)        # File management
  })})
```

Set settings and universal variables
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = here())
```


# Import data

## Network data
Draft version of a network dataset of public water systems. Note that the data is by source so PWSIDs are repeated for as many water sources as the system has. 

```{r}
read.csv("")
```
