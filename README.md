# Overview
This repository cleans, processes, and adds various columns to our dataset of connections between surface water sources and community drinking water systems.

# Structure and Navigation
The 'Scripts/' folder contains all relevant code. Run scripts based on numerical order of subfolders

# Data Sources

Network data: network dataset generated by our team, accessed via Box

SAFER Clearinghouse data
- This is an internal state water board dataset they shared with us for this project. All documentation is located in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gxMrGeaOA_xtGb1zf97Z79EFEwKcIpCG).
- Unfortunately there is no data dictionary, but [Jenny has worked on developing one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ulStajU7D1eFu2m3V0fTDtcm3PGNlneX/edit?gid=631545570#gid=631545570).
- 'SourceReporting' sheet used for geolocation data missing_source_lat_longs.Rmd, as well as to identify groundwater facilities in add_gw_variables_to_network_data.Rmd
- 'WaterSystemInformation' sheet used to filter for only facilities in community water systems in add_gw_variables_to_network_data.Rmd

EDT Data
- Drinking water quality data compiled by the State Water Resources Control Board and downloaded from [this page](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/EDTlibrary.html).
- Data dictionary is available [here](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/documents/edtlibrary/data_dictionary.pdf).
- Used to identify drinking water facilities with MCL violations in add_gw_variables_to_network_data.Rmd

CA SDWIS
- Contains data on PWS's county, state classification, etc.
- Joined into main dataset by PWSID

EPA SDWIS
- Contains data on PWS's population served, wholesale provider, status, etc.
- Joined into main dataset by PWSID
